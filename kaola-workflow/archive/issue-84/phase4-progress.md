# Phase 4 - Progress: issue-84

## Operational Guardrails

Phase 4 is subagent-executed.

Main session may:
- inspect diffs
- run small targeted validation commands
- delegate expensive or noisy validation
- classify failures
- update progress/evidence files
- delegate follow-up fixes
- apply the Trivial Inline Edit Exception

Main session must not:
- write implementation fixes inline except under the Trivial Inline Edit Exception
- write or rewrite tests inline except under the Trivial Inline Edit Exception
- mark a task complete while validation fails

Failure routing:
- behavior/test failure -> tdd-guide
- build/type/lint/tooling failure -> build-error-resolver
- scope/write-set violation -> stop or escalate
- emergency inline fallback -> only with explicit user authorization
