# Kaola-Workflow Research

Phase 1 discovers facts only. Do not choose a solution or edit implementation files.

## Goal Contract

Continue until Phase 1 has parsed requirements, recorded research evidence,
selected a safe workflow project name, written `phase1-research.md`, and updated
`workflow-state.md` with `next_skill: kaola-workflow-ideation {project}`. Stop
only for true external authorization, materially user-owned choices, or
ambiguity that blocks correctness.

## Steps

1. Parse the request:
   - deliverable
   - user value
   - affected area
   - success criteria
   - linked issue, or `none`
2. Generate a deterministic 2-4 word kebab-case project name from the linked
   issue title or task description. If `kaola-workflow/{name}/` exists, append
   the first available collision suffix such as `{name}-2`; do not ask the user
   to confirm routine generated names.
3. Inspect relevant files, tests, config, docs, and issues. Use the `code-explorer` Codex agent role when subagents are available; otherwise perform the same read-only research in the current session.
4. Use the `docs-lookup` Codex agent role only when current external behavior matters; otherwise record why docs lookup is N/A.
5. Write raw notes to `.cache/code-explorer.md` and `.cache/docs-lookup.md` when used.
6. Score completeness from 0-10. Stop and ask if below 7.
7. Write `kaola-workflow/{project}/phase1-research.md` and update `workflow-state.md`.
